# QtDiary

A GUI program that I would like to create to replace Day One, which I currently use to write my personal diary. It should use SQL to store journal entries.

## To Do - Minimal to Function
- [ ] Be able to write an entry to a database
- [ ] Be able to read entries
- [ ] Be able to write an entry to a database, as well as the time at which it was created (or user-specified time)

## To Do - Further Nice Features
- [ ] Obtain the weather and store it with the entry
- [ ] Display weather when an entry is read (e.g. as an emoji)
- [ ] PDF export
- [ ] Import from Day One
- [ ] Backups
